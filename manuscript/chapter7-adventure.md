# Adventure

The Adventure takes place starting in the city of *Bryinda* as described in chapter 5.

Let players create their own characters it's pretty quick, but if they are keen to kick off
or there are any drop in players during place make use of one of the pre-generated characters below:

* Arras the Warrior
* Pyrria the Mage
* Garrik the Treasure Hunter
* Hilda the Explorer
* Balthos the Monk
* Yarrif the Ranger

In the distance smoke rises in the general direction of an upriver settlement, a party is gathered to travel to the settlement and investigate.
While upriver, the river is windy and not the direct route. There are travelling merchants with small river boats on the river bank. One could be persuaded to carry the party upriver for a price.
An alternative route is one of the ancient roads, the “giant’s” road carves cutting through the hillside providing a nice smooth direct route without hills and forest. Half a day's walk from the city is a small settlement, along the road gorge there are lines of meadows, farms and orchards, the area has a faintly alpine feel. Lining the steep unclimbable banks of the road are trees clinging to the side.
A day beyond the settlement is a gang of highwaymen laying ambush at a part of the road just behind where the path has narrowed from a landslip.
If asked the highwaymen have no idea what had caused the smoke, nor have they had anyone pass travelling the other direction.
Once the party reaches the settlement it has been burned to the ground, there are no people, no animals, no bodies. On investigation there are tracks leading off into the mountains, but also footprints leading to the river.
In the mountain are survivors who have fled from the settlement. It was attacked by drones which had come down from the North.
The drone attack was orchestrated by an eccentric AI that if left for another few hundred years will develop a full on fault in being overly protective of the forest. At this point the AI can still be reasoned with and the players could negotiate a settlement
