## Gear

Gear is an alternative way of getting a modifier or multiplier on a skill, or have their own inbuilt “talents”. Gear takes up 1, ½ or ¼ inventory slots, and the inventory slots are equal to the strength of the PC. A pack animal has 4 slots. 

Without a pack or the right gear, a PC can only carry two items at a time, but unless in a very time-restricted situations assume they are able to pick up and drop gear as needed.

A player can come up with anything with approval from the GM for a starting item or pick from the following list, examples of gear are:

* Rope: tie up boat or animal, other creative uses
* Map: +1 to navigation skills
* Torch: avoids the darkness status in a small area
* Book of Lore: +1 to lore rolls on the appropriate topic
* Dictionary: +1 to a language skill (but is slow)
* Expedition Log: +1 to riddle or puzzles
* Stylus and Parchment: +1 to knowledge as the PC can keep a memo
* Pack: gain an additional carry slot and allows carrying more than 2 items
* Flint and steel: survival +1
* Weapon: enables attack rolls with the same skill, see section
* Armour: absorbs some damage, see section
* Shield: improves chance of drawing duels
* Gold coins / Silver coins
* manacles: if you win a duel roll using the unarmed skill you put them in chains, they now have double disadvantage to rolls that use their hands.
* smart clothes: +1 to social rolls
* musical instrument: enables the playing of music
* Magician tools: equipment for repairing and deciphering artefacts +1 to artefact rolls
* Artefact disc: A mysterious disc

## Currency

A typical manual labourer will earn 1 silver piece a day which will be enough for food, firewood and lodging.
Bartering is common, coins can be cut into fractions. The price of gear will fluctuate as will the conversion rate to
gold. Merchants backed by a guild or city will often use credit notes instead of coin as they are much more portable, and
can be issued at need beware of forgeries or merchants offering their own credits (an IOU is only as trustworthy as the group issuing it)

## Artefacts

Artefacts are vast array of powerful magical items, of all shapes and sizes. Their one commonality is they are very
durable (probably a survivorship bias) they are often mysterious and often as dangerous to the wielder.

Strengthen material, alter voice, project voice, so only select people can hear, translate language, problem-solving (siege weaponry, designing tools, buildings, logistics, accounting), lightning, metal detection, medical scans, medical treatment, cancer detection and treatments, Weak Laser, see through object, thermal vision. Strong Laser. Levitation. Invigorate human/animal/plants.
