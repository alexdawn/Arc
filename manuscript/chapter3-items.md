## Gear

Gear is an alternative way of getting a modifier or multiplier on a skill, or have their own inbuilt “talents”. Gear takes up 1, ½ or ¼ inventory slots, and the inventory slots are equal to the strength of the PC. A pack animal has 4 slots. 

Without a pack or the right gear, a PC can only carry two items at a time, but unless in a very time-restricted situations assume they are able to pick up and drop gear as needed.

A player can come up with anything with approval from the GM for a starting item or pick from the following list, examples of gear are:

* Rope: tie up boat or animal, other creative uses

* Dictionary: +1 to a language skill (but is slow)
* Expedition Log: +1 to riddle or puzzles
* Stylus and Parchment: +1 to knowledge as the PC can keep a memo
* Pack: gain an additional carry slot and allows carrying more than 2 items
* Flint and steel: survival +1
* Weapon: enables attack rolls with the same skill, see section
* Armour: absorbs some damage, see section
* Shield: improves chance of drawing duels
* Gold coins
* manacles: if you win a duel roll using the unarmed skill you put them in chains, they now have double disadvantage to rolls that use their hands.
* smart clothes: +1 to social rolls
