# Rules

A skill roll involves D6s, a normal roll will be 2D6 with a target value equal or under that of a PCs attribute and skill. Given the challenge of an action, the GM may ask a player to roll 3 or even 4 dice and take the highest (for disadvantage) or lowest (for advantage) 2 values. If the action is not possible to succeed (a player wishing to jump an implausable distance) or fail (requesting to open an unlocked door) then the roll should not be mad and just acted out or denied as appropriate.

| Target Number  | Double Disadvantage  | Disadvantage | Normal | Advantage | Double Advantage |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ------ | --------- | ---------------- |
|  1*            |                      |              |        |           |                  |
|  2             |                   1% |           1% |     3% |        7% |              13% |
|  3             |                   1% |           2% |     8% |       19% |              32% |
|  4             |                   2% |           5% |    17% |       35% |              52% |

|  7             |                  17% |          32% |    58% |       80% |              91% |
|  8             |                  31% |          48% |    72% |       89% |              96% |
|  9             |                  48% |          64% |    83% |       95% |              98% |
| 10             |                  68% |          80% |    92% |       98% |             100% |
| 11             |                  87% |          93% |    97% |       99% |             100% |
| 12             |                 100% |         100% |   100% |      100% |             100% |

*for TN 1 see the always a chance special rule

## Advantage and Disadvantage

* Examples of double advantage, attempting to use an Artefact with the assistance of an AI
* Examples of advantage, close combat when you’ve the high ground, shooting an arrow when there is no wind,
sailing in calm conditions. Bartering or conducting diplomacy with someone friendly or amenable to your faction. Navigating somewhere familiar.
* Examples of Disadvantage are, trying a skill with only one hand available, or in dim lightning, in bad weather. Shooting an arrow in a forested area
* Examples of double disadvantage is trying a skill that strongly relies on vision while blindfolded, in extremely poor conditions (on a rocking boat in a storm, or on a mud slicked hill in torrential rain)

## Critical Rolls and Twists and Complications

A double 1 is always a success and double 6 is always a failure, unless in the circumstance described by the special rule *always a chance.

**Always a Chance:** Unless the target number is 1 or 12, in which case after rolling a double 1 or a double 6, roll a third dice. If the final result is 111 then it is a miraculous hail mary success and a 666 (a truly an unlucky number) that can humble even the most competent.

Other doubles are a success with a twist or failure with complication, depending on the target number.

Success with a twist could be the reveal of unexpected information, accomplishing the task with a particular flair, or even allow the player making the roll to add a little something to the world or story.

Failure with complication should result in the PC or PCs finding themselves into an even larger predicament than they were before.
Depending on the TN and situation a failure is from the activity should be role-played as being unexpectedly difficult (A locked door being more sturdy or with a better lock, or an enemy being far more skilled at sword-fighter than they appeared), this will often make more narrative sense than your professional adventurer suddenly becoming a clumsy oaf.

Unless a PC has a talent for a second attempt or the special rules for diplomacy/bartering, a player may not attempt a repeat roll doing the exact same action without penalty. The party must find another way of solving the challenge or suffer a large delay or some other cost of failure before repeating the same action (GM discretion, sometimes you really do only get one shot at something).

## Attributes

A human has attributes *Strength*, *Reflex*, *Dexterity*, *Intelligence*, *Knowledge* and *Heart*, with the values between 2 and 5.

* **Strength** represents someone's physical size and strength (in rare situations the attribute can be inverted when being small and light is an advantage).
* **Reflex** represents reaction time, poise and balance. A high value represents cat-like poise, balance and reactions, while a low value is for someone slow or clumsy.
* **Dexterity** represents someone's fine motor skills. A high value is a surgeon's or a clockmaker’s steadiness, while a low value is some shaky or fat-fingered.
* **Intelligence** represents someone’s ability to problem-solve by deduction or intuition. A high value is someone who is a creative problem solver, while a low value is someone dull witted.
* **Knowledge** represents someone’s ability to learn and recall facts and ideas. A high value is someone with an encyclopaedic-like memory and finds it easier to learn, while a low value is someone with a poor memory and struggles even with repetition to remember things.
* **Heart**, represents someone’s charm, likeability and confidence. A high value is someone persuasive who oozes charm and charisma, while a low value is a cold-fish who is standoffish and awkward. (should not be confused with introversion and extraversion)

## Skills

They are trained in a number of skills, humans have a skill between 0 and 5.
Skills are related in a hierarchy, if a PC has zero in a skill they are allowed to use a strongly related skill (same group) at ½ the value, while a weakly related skill (same area) at ¼ the value. Aside from the listed skills, other relations will be allowed at GM’s discretion (this is to avoid players trying it on with using their best skill rather than being creative)

The skill hierarchy is Area -> Group -> Skill. Player characters do not gain XP or skill directly against an area or group.

## Archetypes

To aid the player in crafting a character there are 6 archetypal characters who are more likely than most to be travelling and adventuring together:

* Warrior
* Mage
* Treasure Hunter
* Explorer
* Monk
* Ranger

For the indecisive you could even roll a dice to pick your character's archetype. Each archetype has a number of unique talents they can pick.

### Warrior

There are those who tire of the mundane routine of barrack life or the regimented approach of army life. Those with a flair to either the heroic or the mercenary adopt a life on the road as sword for hire or a defender of the weak. All the best legends involve a travelling swordsman outcast from his home and a warrior desire is to join the illustrious ranks by heroically besting hundred others or slaying a fearsome mechanoid.

**Suggested build:** Strength, Reflex, Heart

* **Deft with a weapon:** roll twice for critical injuries and let the player pick either result (higher for more lethality, or lower to better the chance of taking someone alive)
* **Battlecry:** all good warriors will have a battle cry as they charge in the battle, it could be taken from their home city or their former regiment. This cry in the opening round of combat deals 1 morale damage to all foes in hearing distance. Warriors can take battle cry as an action forgoing the other actions in subsequent rounds to further deal morale damage.
* **Reputation:** Re-roll once on intimidation or inspiration rolls.

### Mage

Mages wield artefacts, while many are bookish and reclusive and live among themselves in almost monastic orders. A travelling hedge mage is someone who has rejected a life of study and practise for their city, guild or lord and is perhaps seeking a legendary or mythical artefact of real power?

**Suggested build:** Intelligence, Knowledge, Dexterity

* **Aptitude for artefacts:** from both training and selection a mage is able to utilise additional functions of artefacts other characters are unable to use.
* **Study:** are able to make either a (passive) or (active) roll to try and discover the use and function of an artefact.

### Treasure hunter

There are many ruins, tombs and other structures in Arc with a horde of treasure and artefacts. There is wondrous jewellery and artefacts of ancient unknowable manufacturers with incredible detail that no craftsman could create by hand. Artefacts are dearly prized by the mages guild and even the other unique and uncraftable treasures are worth far more than even gold. As such there is no shortage of those willing to risk life and limb hunting for such items.

**Suggested Build:** Reflex, Dexterity, Heart

* **Sense for danger:** from surviving so many traps, this hunter seems to have a sixth sense for danger, can re-roll awareness while in a known dangerous area and can re-roll craft rolls for disarming traps.
* **Well prepared:** Once per session the hunter is able to reveal the ideal tool or items for the job, perhaps it is a rope, or a pickaxe, blasting powder, coins to bribe a guard or a luminous lamp. The item must be small enough to fit in their backpack, and must be reasonably feasible that the treasure hunter was able to source it in one of the last cities they visited (nothing too valuable or wacky), the GM has final veto.

### Explorer

Even by the standards of Arc these are well travelled individuals. These are people who have the drive to keep travelling onwards, one more mountain range, one more ocean. After one adventure as soon as they’ve got their strength back they just want to press on. Some of these are members of the Castro Guild. Others have ambition without bound seeking the perfect place to found a city or find the source of much desired exotic goods that even the merchants of can only say they got it from another merchant who got it from another.

**Suggested build:** Heart, Knowledge, Strength

* **Inspiring speech** Explorers can double the morale recovered from making a speech.
* **Wanderlust** Explorer’s never lose morale when lost. When confronted with the unknown re-roll heart rolls. When witnessing a wonder of the ancient or natural world double the morale gain.
* **Standing on the shoulders of giants** Explorers are following in the footsteps of the great and illustrious. This character has had a lifetime of listening to tales of travels or reading the diaries of explorers from past ages. Re-roll lore when it comes to lands, oceans, kingdom, cities, civilizations, or exotic goods.

### Monk

Monks devote their life to one or more of the gods. The PC is most likely a travelling monk making a pilgrimage across Arc visiting all the holy sites they can or might be directly on the errand of a god.

**Suggested Build:** Intelligence, Heart, Knowledge

* **Messenger of the gods** Monk’s are able to speak fiery rhetoric to provoke the common people into enacting the will of the gods. Even kings or emperor’s fear breaking sacred laws when there are those who can inspire the masses with their words and scripture. Re-roll persuasion and double the size of the audience a success will influence.
* **Thy will be done** Monk’s through prayer, reflection and sometimes even direct communication with a god are better able to understand the god’s strange temperaments and desires. Roll disadvantage/advantage one level higher when trying to understand the will or temperament of a god.
* **Prayer** By written and aural traditions the most effective prayers to the gods are passed down generation to generation of monk. Re-roll persuasion when attempting to petition a god with a request.

### Ranger

These are hardy and well travelled individuals, often employed by a city, king or wealthy patron to be their eyes and ears to act as an early warning of danger whether it is an invading army or a swarm of drones. Rangers are equally at home in the wild patrolling the bounds of a city's influence in its outlands or spying or investigating in neighbouring cities. They are well accustomed to both life in the wild but also keeping a low profile in other towns and blending in with other cultures. Given the ancient customs of hospitality to travellers nobody councillor, senator or king can accuse you of spying unless you are caught in the act.

**Suggested Build:** Heart, Reflex, Knowledge

* **Like the back of your hand** a lifetime of travelling the bounds, a ranger know every hill and stream of their cities hinterland, and can live away from settlements for a long time. Re-roll on survival rolls
* **A Nobody** A lifetime of travel, a ranger learns how best to avoid unwanted attention. NPCs roll disadvantage on spotting a ranger in a city.
* **Local Connections** Over their career a ranger will build up a network of useful locals on their circuit. Even in new places their experience from building networks comes in useful. Re-roll persuasion when collecting information.

## Talents
Are special rules for specific situations and skill rolls:
Determined: allow a second attempt at a skill at the cost of one morale (does not stack with other re-roll talents)

* **Passion for X:** gain XP at double rate for that skill
* **Polymath:** Intellectual skills transfer at ½ instead of ¼
* **Polyglot:** Transfer a language skill to another language at ½ the skill instead of ¼ of the skill
* **Spatial Awareness:** roll advantage on anything related to orientation or reorientating
* **Heartless:** no need to fail a heart roll to kill someone unaware or unarmed
* **Fearless:** no moral is lost from others taking a critical injury
* **Empathic:** Able to transfer morale to another PC
* **Optimistic:** Max morale is +2
* **Hardy:** HP is +2
* **Short-sighted:** Advantage in Craft and Disadvantage in ranged combat
* **Long-sighted:** Advantage in ranged combat and disadvantage in craft
* **Introversion:** A complication looses morale in social encounters and gains morale in solitary skills.
* **Extroversion:** A complication gains morale in social encounters and loses morale in solitary skills.
* **Lucky:** Once per session, avoid a complication
* **Aristocratic:** Social roles are advantaged on lesser or equal class in the same culture

## Experience

People learn best from practice and failure. Skills can be improved via repeat practice, if a PC fails a skill roll they gain an experience points (XP) in that skill up to 10. If a PC succeeds a skill roll and has the full 10 XP in that skill, they must spend it to level up. 

A PC who is assisting another will gain 2XP if they fail in their assisting roll so long as the main roll is a success, this represents an accelerated learning from watching another.

No experience is gained from passive (e.g. passive observation) or savings throws (against a raw attribute)

This means levelling up a skill starts easy but gets increasingly hard to reach the max level.

The other way of gaining XP is using the study or practice downtime activities. Learning is best to improve low skills. While, practice is the best way of gaining XP for a PC’s good skills.

## Stratagems

Are either individual or group planned or organised. During a rest, a group of PCs can prep a minor stratagem, or for downtime a PC can prep a major stratagem.

... to complete ...

## Opposed weaknesses

Sometimes an attribute works against someone. A strong PC might break a weak plank of wood they stand on, or a knowledgeable player distracted by a riddle.
Someone with a high heart value will struggle with their morals to murder someone in cold blood and are more susceptible to mental trauma. In these situations invert the attribute by taking 5 minus the attribute value.

## HP and Morale

Health Points (HP) is a measure of a PC's physical energy to carry on the fight and avoid deadly injury, while morale is the PC metal energy. If HP drops to zero, the PC rolls for a critical injury, while if Morale Points (MP) drops to zero, the PC rolls for a trauma.

A normal character will have HP equal to their strength, and morale equal to their heart.

PCs are normally able to recover 1 HP every hour (while resting or undertaking light activity) and 1 MP (while resting or undertaking stress free activity) every day though that could be slowed or halted by status afflictions.

## Assistance

PCs may assist in an action of another before the first player's character rolls, others can declare to assist, they roll either the same skill or whatever is appropriate for the role they are assisting (e.g. a player pointing out handholds for another to climb would not roll for the same attribute and skill, the first would be rolling mobility, while the second observation). Depending on the quality of success or failure, each PC assistant can increase or decrease the main action target number by 1 or 2.

**Too Many Cooks or Many Hands Make light work**

The number of PCs that can assist depend on the type of assistance. For example, vocal direction is limited to one (more would be too confusing or contradictory to listen to), while assistance helping lift an object will depend on the size of an object and how easy it is to hold (e.g. many PCs can help carry a boat, while only a few can fit around an anvil).

Do reward creativity if the whole party each thinks of some way of usefully helping out, then let them. E.g. a shop robbery, the rest of the party is assisted with one making a distraction, the jewellery expert talking the robber through on an earpiece artefact, the lookout, the jewellery, the getaway driver on the wagon. Anything too major, in the Heist example the PC making the distraction, should be promoted to its own separate roll. The main criteria being would such a successes or failure be suitably dramatic and the situation allows for the players to adapt their plan.

## Statuses

While any status is active, PCs recover HP or Morale slower or are even unable to. Every set amount of time a roll will be made to see if the status expires or remains or progressive statuses become more serious.

* **Minor** (recover times are doubled 1 HP per two hours, one MP every 2 days, these afflicts cannot become more serious, roll every day for recovery): blinded, deafened, depressed, exhausted
* **Progressive** (start off as minor, can progress to major and critical) : Bleeding, starving, sick, poisoned, irradiated
* **Major** (can progress to critical, roll every hour): dehydrated, freezing
* **Critical** (failure results in death, roll every minute): drowning/suffocating, burning

**Degrees of severity:** the above categories are suggestions, the GM can tweak as appropriate for the situation (if cold enough someone could freeze in minutes not hours). While afflicted with a status most skill rolls will be at disadvantage or serious disadvantage.

## Travel/Discovery

Both travel and discovery take energy to move across the world. Travel is when the players are moving between known locations, while discovery is when they are travelling to new locations or have become lost or disorientated.

A party is able to move 1 hex per day, halved while in swamp, forest or mountain (unless there is a road in the right orientation), or double while on horseback or boat. Every 3+D6 days, a mini event occurs. 

A map might be an actual map the party has or a mental map they have of a more familiar area, drawn out on a hex grid.

An orientation roll after becoming lost, can be made to try and re-establish a position on a map or relative to known areas. Alternatively, a social roll with locals, or from climbing a hill and finding landmark features are other ways of establishing a position on a map.

Because of the ring, the rising horizon means distant features are clearly visible on the West and East on the map. Players can see all features in two hexes W and E, and one hex N and S. On a hill the range is doubled, the mountain is tripled. The general features of Oceans and mountain ranges can be seen beyond that to the W and E. In forests and deep valleys they cannot see any other hexes. The hexes beyond a mountain hex are obscured, while the party is on a hill only the immediate opposite hex of the mountain is obscured.

### Procedural generation

Rules for procedural generation, sum up the following modifiers from all neighbouring revealed hexes -3 for ocean, -2 shallow sea, -1 marsh, +1 plains, + 2 hills/mountains, +3 mountains/plateau with thin atmosphere. 
For more GM control on the shape of continents tweak the number by either +/-9 depending if the hex should be continental or oceanic.
Roll 3D6:
3-4 Ocean, 5-6 Sea, 7 Marsh, 9 Plains, 10 Forest, 11-13 Hills, 14-16 Mountains, 17-18 high plateau

Double digits will have some special landmark (or when a GM feels is appropriate), pick or roll on the following table:

| Roll D66 | Landmark |

## Combat

Despite the bounty of the oceans and forests and the isolation between cities, human nature means there is always someone looking to take what is not there's. War and violence is not unknown, neither are travelling bandits, highwaymen nor other nay do wells. Between the threat from both human, animal or spirit, most travelling parties are well armed.

Rounds are 1 minute long.

Draw Initiative cards (use a deck of cards or other cards which are numbered 1 to 10), if cards are unavailable roll a D10, for each combatant, some abilities allow swapping of cards in initiative order each PC or NPC will declare if they are attempting to: withdraw, guard, prepare ranged combat, or duel.

A duel target must be against any unengaged target (if any opponent is guarding, they must be picked over another engaged target). After all PC and NPCs have nominated their action, then in reverse initiative order those who picked guard as an action may choose to target an unengaged opponent (or if there are no unengaged opponents left, may pile in to form a 2:1 or 3:1 duel).

Once all actions and targets are picked, resolve in this order: *Disengage*, *ranged combat*, *melee combat*, *other actions*.

If a character attempting to disengage has been targeted, roll with a duel roll, if they succeed they flee the combat, if they fail they take damage and then flee unless either the rolls were a double and they remain trapped in the combat.

Ranged combat makes a roll to hit, against their skill as a TN applying advantage and disadvantage as appropriate (if the PC that is shooting has been engaged they roll at a disadvantage). Apply critical injury on a double 1. If the roll fails on a double, against a target that is engaged, the ranged weapon will hit one of the other duellists at random.

Then resolve the duals in any order, to determine who wins a duel with a roll off 2D6 minus their strength plus weapons skill, the lowest value wins, draws nobody wins. For 2:1 and 3:1 rolls everyone and taking the lowest value for each side.

**Complications in multiple combats**
In a multiple combat there is a chance for multiple combatants to be hit not just the loosing side, if one of the combatants rolls a complication and scores higher than the opposing side (i.e. when in a 1:1 situation they would have lost) the combatant with the complication takes attack damage in addition to the loosing side taking attack damage.

**Keep it speedy**
To keep things speedy in larger battles against low level opponents, a GM can use a duelling TN instead of making roll off. Use the lowest TN if the enemies are a mix.

The winner deals damage unless they were attempting ranged combat, and possible critical injury if they rolled a double 1 (or double 2 with some weapons) or if the loser rolled a double 6. Other double digits the complication is the winner (both in the case of draws) also exhausted by the move, losing 1HP as well.

Aggressive and Defensive stance give a +1 or -1 to the duel roll, but the combatant with that stance will deal -1 or +1 damage (yes damage 1 weapons can go down to zero).

Armour can absorb the first 1-3 points of damage depending on how good it is.

**Example** Jim has a 3 armour, he takes a blow for 5 damage, 3 is absorbed by the armour and Jim looses 2HP.

If a PC or friendly or neutral NPC is reduced to zero HP, everyone who witnesses it loses one MP. If a character dies after being reduced to zero HP lose an additional MP.

## Zero HP and Dying

When a PC drops to zero HP, they become exhausted and all combat actions are at disadvantage. If a PC takes a hit while at zero HP they are now incapacitated dying

For NPCs use simplified rules where they are dead or dying (as narratively appropriate) when they hit zero HP.

## Critical Injury

Deal double damage and roll for critical injury when the winning duellist rolls a 11 (or 22 for some weapons)

## Stealth and ambush

Stealth is used to either avoid combat encounters or to start a combat with favourable circumstances.

If the hidden party beats the searcher they avoid detection or launch an ambush, otherwise they are detected and combat starts.

Roll stealth (worst of the attackers) vs observation (best of the defenders) for a surprise attack. Assistance rolls are not allowed.

Apply advantage or disadvantage for both:
* If there is good cover or suitably coloured clothing, there is advantage, if both double advantage. If there is a lack of cover, or the hiding party has lights/torches, roll disadvantage.
* If the defenders are expecting an attack or have equipment such as: night vision, motion detection, animal or drone scouts, roll advantage. If both double advantage.
* If their vision is impaired through darkness or weather such as fog roll disadvantage.

Victims of a successful surprise attack loose one morale, the attackers get one free ranged volley (if they have ranged weapons) and any close combat in the first round is at disadvantage to the surprised side.

**Cat and mouse:** for a group role if narratively it makes sense and the defenders critically succeeds while the attacks fail, the roles are reversed (role-play one or more of the defenders away from the main party sneaking up and surprising the ambushers.

## Diplomacy/Barter

Sooner or later you will be in foreign lands and of need of a hand. While the ancient customs of travel mean people will be respectful (if wary) and in most lands and cities will have laws to protect you, being far from home and resources you will need to rely on your wit and charm to gain useful items, get assistance or an important item.

*TN = Social + Merch/Diplomacy + size of request - offering*

Request/Offering modifiers:
* Small +/- 0
* Medium +/- 1
* Large +/- 2
* Outrageous +/- 3

In both cases the diplomacy barter roll depends on the size of the request, how friendly they are to you, your city or your guild, what you are offering in return and your character's social skill. Applying advantage/disadvantage if appropriate.

**Haggling** you are allowed to repeat a barter roll so long as the TN is easier than the last (by making a more modest request or offering more) than the last, and you can repeat as many times until the deal is made, or a complication is rolled (the NPC you are dealing with has run out of patience or somehow has been offended and will not continue bartering with you for the present moment)

## Downtime

## Sights and Wonders

Ancient stones, ancient pyramids, a vast spiralled pit, a grand bridge or viaduct, a wooded valley and stream with a metal structure and many skeletons. Sunken cities. Arc is vast and mysterious, it would take a thousand lifetimes to even fully explore a small part of it.

There are many travellers speaking of the impressive or impossible, and most journeys into the continent will show enough that suggests there is much more out there to be discovered.

These are mythical technologies, that there are plenty of stories about but may or make not exist (at GMs discretion if you introduce these technologies they may be game breaking):
Portals, time travel, freezing time, teleportation, FTL, transmutation
(while not clark tech an operating spacecraft or even an aircraft will strongly change the character of travel in the game, and should be avoided)
