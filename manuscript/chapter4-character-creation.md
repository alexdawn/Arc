# Creating Characters

## Attributes

Give your players two options: random attribute or attribute allocation.

Attributes first: generate them randomly, more realistic as nobody picks the circumstance of their birth, for each attribute roll (2D6 and divide by 3) + 1, rounding up.

| 2D6 | Attribute |
| --- | --------- |
|   2 |         2 |
|   3 |         2 |
|   4 |         3 |
|   5 |         3 |
|   6 |         3 |
|   7 |         4 |
|   8 |         4 |
|   9 |         4 |
|  10 |         5 |
|  11 |         5 |
|  12 |         5 |


Archetype first: is more fun for players who have a character in mind. Players have 18 points and must put between 2 and 5 points in each skill.

The mathematicians among you might spot that the average starting attributes for a random build is slightly higher, a perk for those risking the unpredictability of dice.

## Archetype and talents

All players have an archetype, and pick one archetype talent and one generic talent.

## Skills

Players get one starting four skill, two starting three skills, three starting two skills and four starting one skills. Remaining skills are zero.
