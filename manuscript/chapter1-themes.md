Exploration, Discovery and Lost tech

* * *

All who look into the sky see stretching off as an arc into the sky, a silvery blue band of green lands, and towering mountain ranges and azure seas all away across the sky. Such a sight can not help but stir the heart’s desire to travel. The theme of the game are exploration and discovery in a vast and mysterious world.

Arc is vast and empty with plenty for all. It designed temperate climate means it is full of bountiful oceans and forests. While not a desperate struggled to survive, because of individual's greed or desire for glory there are still warmongers, the power hungry and thieves, a theme is how players oppose these rogues or fall victim to these darker desires.

*“All sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”*
*- Arthur C. Clark*

Scattered across Arc are mysterious artefacts and ancient structures. A few humans have an aptitude for manipulating these artefacts with strange and awesome powers, while more are able to make use of the most simple artefacts.

Out in the great emptinesses of the continent interiors there are beasts, mechanoids and godlike entities. There are some who think these are where the truth of the legends of who created Arc if it was created at all. There are no shortage of Adventurers, merchants and travellers with a strange tale to tell.

Mechanoids, drones and AI entities are a pathaeon of strange, capricious and unpredictable gods, whether they are helpful, malicious or just unaware of the humans they can be a danger too.
