# The World

The following section is given in the context of an outsider to Arc, to better compare it with Earth for the reader. Many of the facts presented here are have been forgotten or only myths or legends to the inhabitants.

## Location

The ring is made up of a series of relatively small continent sized landforms separated by small, narrow oceans. The surface is evenly covered by land and sea. The climate is largely temperate across most of the surface being regulated by the well placed seas.

The edge of the band is an immense wall of an unknown unbreakable metal, in most locations buried under large amounts of ice that has built up so that appears as an enormous ice wall.

The mountains are young, steep and not yet worn and craggy from millennia of weathering. Artificially created by whoever made the ring, hidden among them are the occasional vast statues of faces, or strange scenes depicting orbs.

The world has no continental plates or tectonic activity, and other large natural disasters such as hurricanes or floods are rare from the even temperature. Recently visible in the sky is a comet with immense tail bearing portentous omens. There are a few artificial volcanos which the creators of Arc added as a source of fresh nutrient rich volcanic rock, the bedrock being heated by advanced solar lenses studded along the outer surface of the ring.

While not a natural planet, the creators had seeded the ring with crushed and melted rock from asteroids, some of which are rich in ores and metals. The main thing is the serious lack of metamorphic rock and gems that are formed deep in a planetoid, as such these materials are greatly prized.

Unlike Earth, the weather is generally mild. There is some seasonal variation from the tilt of the ring, but since the interior of the ring is un-curved from edge to edge it is the same season across the whole ring, with two summers (warm and wet) and two winters (cool and dry) per orbit of Arc’s Star.

Snow is rare other than at the edges of the ring or at higher altitudes. The tallest ranges and plateaus reach above the atmosphere, presumably for the creators to easily land and launch spacecraft.

Night is brighter than Earth’s full moon thanks to the day side of Arc illuminating its dark side.

The relatively young continents mean there the land is mostly wooded hills and mountains, with few plains from rivers depositing silt.

Animals and plants are recognizably similar to those on Earth, though subtle evolutionary changes have occurred to adapt to the mild climate and brighter nights.

Scattered across the land (and probably under the seas) are large ancient metal structures that are old as the ring itself.

## Continent 16

*Bryinda* is a small city on *Kanostra bay* on the Spinward edge of the sixteenth continent. Part of the *Kanostran League* of a dozen other cities around the bay and on the archipelago, as a defensive pact against the *Zathus* and *Mirthrian Kingdoms*. Throughout the vast bay are many small island clusters, the larger of which housing fishing villages.

*Bryinda* has the river *Bryrith* flowing through it, which is wide enough for boats to navigate the first 20 miles, to a number of smaller settlements and logging camps. After this the river splits in two and is too rocky for large vessels, the banks are thickly forested and there are tales of mysterious spirits and dangerous outlaws in these woods.

Also leaving *Bryinda* is one of the “giants” ways, an ancient road that traverses through forest then cuts through the *Bathel Mountains*. *Bryinda* has the Bathel Guild that offers travelling party guides on the best routes through the mountains. Section where landslips have made the narrower parts of the ancient way impassible. The Bathel have numerous offshoots of roads and many ancient ruins and tunnels that are easy to get lost in. Rumours of gold and artefacts in these tunnels abound. More than one treasure hunter has returned to *Bryinda* with riches. The local Mage's guild have a small camp and archaeological dig.

Despite the risks of getting lost, the route remains relatively well travelled as on the opposing side is the city of *Kalishem* and the bulk of the overland continent.

There is a fisherman’s tale that that at the bottom of bay there lies a drowned city, locals with boats avoid travelling there after dark.

On the headlands there is a narrow defensible mouth to the bay, stone forts owned by the league have been built on both sides with more sea forts built on the remains of metal pillars that cross the mouth. A series of chains that can be raised to prevent boats entering or leaving the bay are arrayed from fort to fort. Legends says the sea fort pillar was an ancient bridge. 

Above the forts on the top of either hill are large ancient structures, one forms a citadel of the city of *Alieus* and the other is a temple to *Occant* God of the sea. City elders say *Occant* would often appear to onlookers on the plaza in front of the temple when they were young but the god has not appeared for many decades now, the secretive Monastic order who run the temple do not admit others to the temple and to those impious enough to inquire are told *Occant* has more important things to do that make appearance. Elderly fisherpeople also say the sea is less calm than it used to be in the old days, and there are more frequent tales of monsters and pirates out in the open ocean.

Bryinda is a limited democracy where voting right extend to only citizens born in the city walls or have a certain amount of land. The current Prinister of Bryinda is *Olus Mondila* who in less than a year will be seeking a second term. Due to the city being at the confluence of river and road there is a large port where merchant vessels offer onward travel for travelling parties up and down the coast as well as a few over to continent 17.


## Human Culture

Humans are spread across the continents, organised variously as small cities, remote farmsteads or travelling bands of nomads. Generally at a technology level similar to that of classical antiquity on earth.

Population densities overall all are low, partly the hilly terrain being unsuitable for larger kingdoms or empires and partly from the lack of disease means that infant mortality low and family sizes are small by the standards of other civilisation of this technology level. While arable farmland is quite limited, the forests and oceans are both bountiful and easily able to support the populations of the isolated city states.

### Cities

Cities are generally small walled cities built around a hill or one of the ancient structures. General construction is wooden, or plastered brick, few are stone due to the rarity of good building stone.

Rule is typically a king or noble councillors while in rarer cases a confederation of merchant princes.

Connecting some of the older cities are enormous “giant's” ways, which are ancient straight and level ways that leave a scar through the landscape. The modern tracks that follow these ways are far narrower than the width of the ancient ways, the rest of the ways are often filled with fields, orchards, meadows and even small villages. While far from the cities, the ways have become overgrown with encroaching woodland. Here there are still metal remains of the ancient ways that has not been looted.

### Society

Perhaps a remnant from before humans had arrived on Arc, but it is relatively egalitarian with regard to race and gender though many cities have become stratified by class with heredity occupations.

The few thousands years humans have been on Arc is long enough for distinct language and cultures to emerge and drift but not long enough for the humans to have changed much in appearance.

Education is good considering the technology levels, due to the low levels of diseases and good life expectancy.

### Religion

Religion is pretty much ubiquitous when you can see and commune with the gods. There will always be a few exceptions sects, cults or philosophers who would try and argue otherwise, that there is only one god or none at all.

Most households will have a shrine to a god or two. Priests are a highly respected profession who are able to take prayers and petitions from outlying settlements to the particular god's temple.

### Travel

Travel is relatively common and in most places protected by ancient customs of hospitality, most settlements will be willing to feed and house travellers especially if they have brought news, post or other useful information from their neighbours.

On the road you'd come across numerous and varied peoples: merchants, pilgrims, scholars, tax collectors, nobles on their grand tour. Often travelling together for mutual protection. Foot and horses are the most common form of transport with the exception of royalty or chief mage who might have a very rare horse-less carriage artefact.

### Mages and artefacts

There are some people who have a particular affinity or aptitude for the ancient artefacts that can be found across Arc. These artefacts in right hands are capable of great and impossible feats of magic. These come in all shapes and sizes and capable of many different functions. Some are simple with a single usage able to be used by anyone, while others are complex and via interacting and interpreting the symbols are capable of performing a vast array of different function that only someone trained in one of the mages guilds are able to work with them.
New artefacts are strange and often dangerous, so a mage's guild is kept at a distance from the rest of a city outside of the city walls. Experiments are performed in testing pits due to the tendency of artefacts to explode, arc lighting or emit toxic fumes. Scars are the mark that distinguishes a veteran mage.

## Guilds

### Castro Guild

The Castro guild, their official name being “Cartographic and Astronomers Guider Society” are mapmakers who use a telescope to learn and draw maps of distant lands visible in the Arc as well as star maps. A castro guilder or one of their maps are greatly prized in a longer distance travelling party. While residents of an observatory, sooner or later the urge to travel to the lands they’ve mapped is too great, and a guilder will look to join a party travelling on.

A guilder has a vast and bemusing set of customs and rituals. Unlike other Guilds are more cohesive and regular across the known continents. It is suspected they have a secret way of communicating vast distances. This is conducted from signalling with the telescopes and giant mirrors hidden on the top of their observatory towers. The mirrors are only bright enough to be visible at dawn and dusk and one of the jobs of the apprentice is to track the terminator across the ring, keeping an eye out for messages from far off lands.

Signalling is a complex language and while it takes months or years, these days they can even pass the information required for copying maps to one another.

### Artificers Guild

Artificers, colloquially called mages, are people who study and use Artefacts. Their guild halls are often at a distance from the rest of a settlement due to their tendency to explode or burn down. 

Apprentices are often selected from teenagers who have an interest in the exotic and the arcane, selection is a mixture or merit or as a favour in return for donations from merchant and noble families.

Anyone well travelled enough will know it is not strictly speaking one guild, but a federation of associated guilds, each with their own specialism and philosophies. There are even a few unsanctioned groups, which have been expelled for practising especially dangerous artefacts.

The guild in Bryinda is built on the ruins found in an archaeological dig site, outside the city walls. The hall houses numerous built in artefacts: projectors, terminals and charging ports. Mystery artefacts are tested in adjacent pits to minimise collateral damage from the occasional explosion or release of toxic gas or arcs of lighting.

### Other Guilds

While the Artificers and the Castro Guild are the two most powerful organisations ubiquitous across the known continents, there are many others Guilds large and small. The Traveller's guild, various merchant, craftsman, seafarers, archaeological and philosophers guilds.

## Beings

Scattered across Arc are many AI and drone beings. The inhabitants treat them as spirits, gods and demi-gods, for the most part they are kept at a distance for they are unpredictable and capricious or aloof, with only the rare pilgrimage where people leave them offerings and prayers. While a few are helpful enough that cities have been built up around the AI’s structure as a temple to the patron God of that city.

### AI

Each AI has a particular domain they manage with ancient commands and directives, many of which over 1,000s of years have become a corruption or a distortion or a latent flaw with their optimization. 

A very long time ago AI researchers had found AIs very suited out unconventional or out of the box thinking, an algorithm directed to balancing a pencil above a table for the longest time might find throwing it in the air would work, or an algorithm for designing a robotic body to run a race would find a very tall body that only has to fall onto the finish line to win the race. Most effort was then to try and reign in such unconventional thinking.

It was found that the most reliable way of using AI was by having a vast array of specialist personalities that would seek agreement by consensus. Some of the different AI responsibilities are/were weather management, forestry, ecology, light management, repair and maintenance, psychologists, teachers, counsellors, planners, assistants, anti-meteor defence lasers. 

The hardware that powers AI are stored within the ancient metal structures that scatter the surface. AI can communicate with humans in their domain via holograms and sound projection. The hologram can project any image, though an AI may have particular a favourite avatar they appear as.

Most AI either are uncaring or make use of their perceived godhood and will not correct such misunderstanding among the populous.

### ZombAI

The AI are uncoordinated with very limited communication, very few AIs will be willing to say, but the communication network was shut down as a result of a very corrupting memetic virus. The corrupted AIs are deranged spreaders of the virus.

Upon realisation of the threat, the surviving AIs agreed to disconnect themselves from the network. This threat is why AIs are reclusive, isolationist, mistrustful and uncoordinated. Without the group consensus eccentricities are allowed unchecked to multiply.

### Drones

Drones are of much more limited intelligence, small hovering robots, there are rare cases of mages able to keep tame ones as familiars and use them to accomplish errands. Others are dutifully carrying out their ancient instructions and programming either alone or with their original AI, while others have been co-opted by another AI with their own agenda.
