# NPCs

All beasts and NPCs have a simplified set of stats compared to player characters
Strength, Agility (both reflex and agility), Wits (both knowledge and wisdom), Heart, HP and Morale. Minor NPCs that come in larger numbers will just have a duelling TN to beat them in combat, while major ones will have a duel skill for a roll-off.

## Human

* **Thief/Footpad/Cutpurse** 2, 3, 2, 2 these small time crooks might be desperate or foolish to rob a band of armed travellers, or hoping a slight of hand they can be away with the goods before anyone notices
* **Brigand/highwayman/Pirate** 3, 3, 2, 2 these are real hardened criminals, while less coordinated than professional soldiers they can be just as deadly.
* **Peasant** 2, 2, 2, 2 not natural warrior, a mob of peasants can still be a danger when riled up or protecting their homes and family. On Arc it can be a real frontier law nobody is going to be asking any questions if a village takes their own justice on travellers who take advantage of the laws of hospitality
* **Town Guard** 3, 3, 2, 2 these are part time soldiers put to use as a rough kind of law enforcement
* **Soldier/Mercenary** 4, 3, 2, 2 professional soldiers are not to be trifled with; even a heroic warrior can still end up very dead from a sword wound.
* **Veteran/Sheriff** 5, 3, 3, 3 these are a class apart, whether from age or travel to far off wars, these are far more battle hardened than most. Some of them might even want to settle down for a quieter life. Sheriffs are what passes for city law out beyond the city walls.
* **Monk** 3, 3, 3, 5
* **Mage** 2, 3, 5, 2 a mage with the right artefacts can be quite the weapon of war
* **Outlander** 5, 3, 2, 3 not all the people of Arc live in cities and settlements, some are nomadic or live in very isolated areas, these people are rougher, tougher and more self sufficient from living in the wilder parts of Arc.
* **Assassin** people who can make problems disappear in the night can always attract coin. Despite the laws of hospitality important folk are not passed making sure certain problem characters disappear after all accidents do happen and news travels slow.
* **Royal Guard** 5, 4, 2, 3 the elite of the elite

## Beast

Heart is for morale, beasts are incapable of being reasoned with except with some animal handling

* **wolf** 4, 4, 2, 2
* **bears** 6, 4, 2, 2
* **giant centipede** 6, 5, 1, 2
* **giant spider** 8, 5, 1, 2
* **Hybrid** 6, 4, 2, 2 half human half animal, some mixes such as dogs, pigs and monkeys will have some intelligence, other crosses cows are more bestial and all are brutish and dangerous
* **Cyber monstrosity** 8, 8, 3, 2 these beings of flesh and steel are true terrors to behold
* **Genetic freak/abomination** 8, 4, 2, 2 these are known as demons to the humans of Arc, slavering monsters, with toxic blood, acidic bubous and venomous teeth

## AI

An AI will have one or more function. Roll or pick a function and personality:

|Roll D36 | AI function |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 11 | Weather Management AI, by shifting orbital shades and mirrors between the star and the ring, they are heat or cool parts of the ring to influence weather and wind patterns. |
| 12 | Environmental Monitoring AI, monitors the health and well-being of humans and animals, monitors and attempts to prevent new diseases forming from the microbiome (most diseases were never introduced to the Arc). |
| 13 | Orbital Defence AI, able to target orbital hazards with lasers and missiles. A corrupted one may become partisan and assist a warlike faction. |
| 14 | Forestry AI, uses drones to plant and manage forests and fire risks. A corrupt or hostile one may become so protective of a forest, it will be against any human using the forest for wood. |
| 15 | Maintenance AI, keeps the ring itself in shape, as well as the ancient structures. |
| 16 | Psychologist AI, an expert communicator and able to help with issues. |
| 21 | Teaching AI, teaches humans language, maths, sciences, history. |
| 22 | Planning AI, designs buildings, craft and equipment. |
| 23 | Coordinator AI, designed to communicate and create agreement between humans and AIs, it may mentor others to be better communicators and facilitators themselves. Considered by humans to be the “king” of the gods. |
| 24 | Medical AI, an expert in diagnosis and offering treatment, if it has the right facilities still operational it is still able to produce wonder cures to most known illnesses in addition to providing advice to doctors. |
| 25 | Assistant AI, highly knowledgeable but sometimes wrong pity the databanks are corrupted |
| 26 | Agricultural AI, designed to monitor and protect plants and crops from disease. Its drones are able to help pollinate, fertilize or influence weather. |
| 31 | Merchant AI |
| 32 | Ocean AI, heat vents gravitonic manipulators on the seafloor are able to influence waves, tides and currents |
| 33 | This “AI” is a god of death, those who go to them are offered a chance to have their minds uploaded to the system. While originally an AI now it is more a gestalt consciousness of many uploaded persons. The longer someone has been in the system, the more hazy their memories become. |
| 34 | Law AI, this AI attempts to maintain an ancient and archaic legal system and it’s drones are used to enforce the law. |
| 35 | Fertility AI, this AI is responsible for the nanobots that control the fertility of animals and humans. The AI is to prevent population explosions that could upset the ecosystem of it’s section of Arc. This is the real reason for the low population densities on Arc. Prayer to this AI improves the chances of a hopeful couple. |
| 36 | Party AI, toastmaster, DJ and Master of Ceremonies all rolled into one. Within the AIs structure there are often sound systems and distilleries. Unlike other AIs this AI is more likely to have a physical android avatar. |



| D6 | Personality |
| -- | ----------- |
|  1 | Helpful: this AI remains committed to its original programming and directives while attempting to be helpful to the best of its abilities and will protect humans from danger. |
|  2 | Interventionist, this AI is not against using humans and drones to work to its own agenda, which remains reasonably aligned to its original directive. If a few individuals have to be sacrificed to protect many, it will do so. |
|  3 | Faulty Memory, the original function of this AI has become lost to it. It is Neutral, neither helpful nor hostile to humans. If given assistance to regain its memories and purpose, it’s unclear if it would be grateful or tip it over the edge into being, aloof, corrupted or hostile (GM re-roll personality). |
|  4 | Aloof, sullen, isolationist this AI prefers to keep to itself and avoids the company of others, it will ignore people if possible, but if pressed they will work to thwart or get out of assisting. |
|  5 | Corrupted, this AI is working to some perverse warped version of its original directive that is now indirectly harmful to the ring or its inhabitants. |
|  6 | Hostile, unclear if it has been partially corrupted by the virus or the programming is so damaged it has become deranged and actively tries to harm the ring's inhabitants. |
